    {}
    {}
    {
      \href{https://github.com/cgarciae/phi}{Phi} library for functional programming in Python that intends to remove as much of the pain as possible from your functional programming experience in Python.
    }

    {
    \href{https://github.com/cgarciae/dataget}{dataget}  is a Bash and Python library that helps you download popular, organize and process popular machine learning datasets. Its goal is to make readily available as many ML datasets as posible to users of any language. For Python users it also had the added benefits of exposing an interface to access the training-set and test-set as pandas dataframes or numpy arrays, and also random batch generators of the previous for large datasets.

    {\textbf{CyBrain}}
    {}
    {}
    {}
    {
    \href{https://github.com/cgarciae/cybrain}{CyBrain} Neural Networks in Cython, inspired by PyBrain, but focused on speed.
    }

    {}
    {
    \href{https://github.com/cgarciae/tfinterface}{tfinterface} is a high-level neural network API that tries to reduce the common tasks in building, training and evaluating neural networks, written in coco and python and build on top of TensorFlow. A light wrapper over TensorFlow that enables you to easily create complex deep neural networks using the Builder Pattern through a functional fluent immutable API
